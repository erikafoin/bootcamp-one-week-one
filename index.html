    <h2> About Erika</h2>
    <article>My name is Erika, and I live in North Portland with my husband (who is conveniently named Eric), my children Nicolas and Annika, and two guinea pigs named Pepper and S'mores which theoretically belong to my children but they are not the ones who are cleaning the cage. I grew up in California, but went to college at Lewis & Clark College and returned to Oregon as soon as possible. Let me tell you more about some of my major interests!
    </article>
    <h3> Music</h3>
        <p>Classical music has been a part of my life for a very long time. I studied classical music composition in both undergraduate and graduate school. In addition to composing, I play the following instruments (in order of skill):
            <ol>
                <li>Oboe</li>
                <li>English Horn</li>
                <li>Piano</li>
                <li>Irish Flute</li>
                <li>Pennywhistle</li>
            </ol>
        I still play the oboe and English Horn in community orchestras. I quit one orchestra this year in anticipation of starting school, but I still play with the Oregon Sinfonietta on Thursday nights.
        
        
        <aside>(Fun fact: the English Horn is neither from England nor is it a horn.)</aside>

        </p>
    <h3> Pets</h3>
        <article>Nicolas is 13 and in 8th grade this year. He is interested mainly in one thing: Magic the Gathering and all associated games and events. We live very near a game store and he spends the majority of his free time there.
        </article>
        <article> Annika is 10 and is in 5th grade. She is interested in many team sports, primarily soccer and ice hockey, and is often found on the playing field. She also loves Broadway musicals.</article>
        <article> Our two guinea pigs, Pepper and S'mores, share a common interest of eating and pooping nonstop.</article>

        <aside>(Fun fact: Guinea Pigs are neither from Guinea nor are they pigs.)</aside>

    <h3> Places I've Been</h3>
    <p> I've lived in the following places (in chronological order):
        <ul>
            <li>Davis, California</li>
            <li>Chiang Mai, Thailand</li>
            <li>Portland, Oregon</li>
            <li>London, England</li>
            <li>St. Paul, Minnesota</li>
            <li>Boston and Newton, Massachusetts</li>
        </ul>
        I've also visited many countries, mostly in Asia and Europe. I consider my trip to Myanmar in 2010 to be the highlight of my travels; I have never seen so many temples in my life. (Pro tip: they all pretty much look the same.)

        <aside>(Not-so-fun fact: Myanmar's previous name, Burma, should not be used as the name refers to the ethnic majority, while there are actually 135 different ethnic groups who live in the country.)</aside>
